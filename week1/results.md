## Level 1

### Indexing with more fields mapped

#### Index using the class field mappings

```
INFO:Indexing ../datasets/product_data/products to bbuy_products with 8 workers, refresh_interval of -1 to host localhost with a maximum number of docs sent per file per worker of 200000 and 200 per batch.
INFO:Done. 1275077 were indexed in 2.5614970270833335 minutes.  Total accumulated time spent in `bulk` indexing: 8.294717284033334 minutes
```

#### Index using the default field mappings

```
INFO:Indexing ../datasets/product_data/products to bbuy_products with 8 workers, refresh_interval of -1 to host localhost with a maximum number of docs sent per file per worker of 200000 and 200 per batch.

```

*"We added more fields, which both increased our extraction time (as seen by the overall time increasing) and our indexing time increased as well because we sent a bigger payload and had more indexing to do."*

```

*"It isnâ€™t all that uncommon to see performance improve and then degrade again as batch size increases. The likely cause of this is more time spent accumulating the docs in bulk versus time spent in network, swap or other activities like garbage collection, disk I/O, etc."*

### Indexing with different number of workers
