# OpenSearch cluster w/ 3 uniform nodes plus a dashboard node
# Needs minimum ~ 5 GB RAM on the host

# NOTE: We use a few configuration anti-patterns here to make this work in environments
# where you don't control the underlying host (GitPod, docker-in-docker, etc.).  These
# are indicated by "AP:" in the comment.  See the week 3 appendix of the class for more info.
# Don't use these "AP:" settings in a real OpenSearch environment!
